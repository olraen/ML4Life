**👋 Welcome to our landing page for our biostatistics and machine learning courses.**

- **For who?** For PhD students, researchers, university staff, and professionals in life sciences in Sweden who analyze research data.
- **By whom?** By NBIS, SciLifeLab bioinformatics platform, Sweden.
- **Where?** At Uppsala Biomedical Centre, Uppsala, Sweden.

Currently, we run two courses, a basic one, Introduction to Biostatistics and Machine Learning, and more advanced one, Machine Learning for Life Sciences.

## [Statistical Methods for Life Sciences](course-STATS.html)

Using real research examples, the course introduces core ideas of statistical inference and guides participants through widely used models such as regression, mixed-effects models for repeated or hierarchical data, and survival analysis. The course is suitable both for those with limited prior training and for researchers already applying statistical methods who want a stronger conceptual foundation to confidently choose, apply, and interpret statistical analyses in their own work.

## [Machine Learning for Life Sciences](course-ML4LS.html)

The course provides an introduction to machine learning methods and workflows for life science research. It introduces the full end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, interpretation, and reproducible reporting, with a focus on the analysis of complex, high-dimensional biological data. Participants explore biological datasets using unsupervised methods such as dimensionality reduction and clustering, and build predictive models using supervised approaches including linear and tree-based models. Methods for multi-omics integration, including partial least squares (PLS), are introduced together with specialized modeling settings relevant to life sciences, such as mixed-effects models and survival analysis.
